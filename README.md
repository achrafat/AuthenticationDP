# AuthenticationDP

Welcome to the Authentication Methods Implementation Project!

This repository houses a comprehensive demonstration of authentication methods implemented using design patterns. Within this project, you'll find a powerful utilization of various design patterns to enhance the efficiency and extensibility of authentication protocols.

Key Features:

Factory Design Pattern for Authentication Protocols:
Experience the Factory design pattern in action, enabling the creation of authentication protocols such as JWT and OAuth. By employing this pattern, the project offers a streamlined approach to generating different authentication methods effortlessly.

Strategy Design Pattern for Extensibility:
Embrace the Strategy design pattern, a driving force behind the extensibility of this project. Through its implementation, the project remains open to incorporating multiple authentication protocols without altering the core structure.

Adapter Design Pattern for Protocol Adaptation:
Witness the Adapter design pattern enhancing the adaptability of the JWT class to seamlessly integrate with the authentication framework. This adaptation empowers the JWT class to implement the authentication interface effectively.

Comprehensive Testing Approach:
The project is thoughtfully accompanied by a comprehensive suite of tests, ensuring robust functionality and confirming the integrity of the implemented design patterns.

Design Patterns Explained:

Factory Design Pattern:
The Factory pattern is a creation pattern that provides an interface for creating instances of classes without specifying the exact class to be instantiated. In this project, the Factory pattern simplifies the process of generating diverse authentication protocols.

Strategy Design Pattern:
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. By implementing the Strategy pattern, this project allows flexibility in choosing and altering authentication protocols.

Adapter Design Pattern:
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper. In the context of this project, the Adapter pattern ensures smooth integration between the JWT class and the authentication framework.

Step into the world of authentication methods and design patterns, where solutions are optimized, extensible, and adaptable. Explore, contribute, and embark on a journey of advancing your understanding of design patterns and their application in authentication systems. Happy coding!
